		<h1 id="title"> Recipe: Tinga de Pollo </h1>
		
		<p> Tinga is a classic Mexican dish, it can be made with chicken or

		<h3>Steps</h3>
			<ol>
				<li class="pasos">In a medium pot, bring 5 cups of water (or broth) to a boil. Add the 
				chicken, a quarter of an onion, the bay leaf, 1 garlic clove, and salt & pepper to taste. 
				If you did not use chicken broth, add 1 cube of chicken bouillon. Lower
				the temperature to a rolling boil. Cook for 40-50 minutes.
				If you would like to speed up the process, feel free to split the chicken
				in half or quarters beforehand. </li>
				
				<li class="pasos">Remove the chicken from the heat. You can wait for the chicken to cool
				while you continue with the other steps or if you're impatient you can 
				shred the chicken now using two forks. It's ok if the chicken is not fully cooked,
				it will finish cooking in the sauce later on.</li>	
							
					<ul>	
						<li id="optional">Optional: If your spice tolerance is low you must scrape out the seeds of
						the chipotle peppers. On a cutting board carefully slice the peppers down
						the middle and scoop out the seeds using a spoon. If you would like some spice, 
						set aside a small amount of seeds, you can add those in the next step. 
						Remember, do not touch your eyes. </li>
					</ul>
				
				<li class="pasos">In a blender add: 3 tomatoes sliced in quarters, the other quarter of the
				onion, 1-2 garlic cloves, the chipotle peppers with the adobo sauce, and 
				half a cup of the chicken broth (remember to take out the bay leaf). Blend until smooth.</li>
								
				<li class="pasos">Cut one onion into medium to thin slices, lengthwise. Check out this
				great tutorial from Cooking Guide called,<a id="link" href="https://youtu.be/5EYY2J3nb5c">
				"Food Cutting and Slicing: How to Thinly Slice an Onion"</a>.</li>
				
				<li class="pasos">Heat the oil in the large saute pan over medium heat. When the oil is shimmering, add 
				the onion slices. When they become transluscent in color, add the tomato-chipotle sauce 
				from the blender. Heat the sauce for 5 minutes then add the shredded chicken.
				Simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the chicken is soft and tender.</li> 
				
					<ul>
						<li>Optional: I like to remove the chicken from the heat and wait for the sauce to absorb 
						into the chicken. This is essential if you are serving the tinga on tostadas or you may have to
						strain the chicken from the liquid.</li>
					</ul>
			</ol>

		<p id="conclusion">See? It wasn't that difficult. Besides the simplicity of this dish, the best part is that you 
		can easily reheat the leftovers, and it's always a crowd pleaser.</p>
