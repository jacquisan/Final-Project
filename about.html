  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
		
    <p>EZ Chef prioritizes helping college students with different recipes that can help them
			make cooking easy despite their busy schedule, limited supplies and intentions with their food!</p>
  
    <p>EZ Chef began as a simple idea. A question the founders asked themselevs after CS103, what 
			am I gonna eat for dinner? This question led to an idea. Wouldn't it be great of there was a website 
			you can get easy recipes that consider college students finaical funds, limited time, and simply 
			just taste good!</p>
											
		<p> When considering the idea of what kinds of recipes we needed to download and investigate 
			 multiple websites and different cooks recipes. However, we were missing the main ingredient to 
			 our research...us. We are three students in Boston University and we cook! we
			 didn't need to investigate different recipes and different cooks, we are the cooks.</p>
											
		<p> All of the recipes and photos are created and taken by us! along with our community
				of friends on campus. This evidently led to our goal to create a website where other 
				students can not only search and use the recipes but share theirs as well.</p>
											
		<p> We encourage our visitors to look through every recipe! cook and share. At the same time
				we are constantly looking for more foods and plates to share with the rest. We welcome all
				types of recipes whether its gourmet or done in 5 minutes. Along those lines we've created 
				a community section where people can chat and comment about their take on our recipes
				as well as share and create conversation. </p>
